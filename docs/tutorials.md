# *precision-medicine-toolbox* tutorials
The *precision-medicine-toolbox* functionality is illustrated in the following notebooks. 
You can clone the *precision-medicine-toolbox* repository to your computer and find the Jupyter files 
in the *examples* folder. The *data* folder is for imaging data. 
The scripts can be corrected accordingly.
## Imaging module
How to explore the imaging parameters, perform basic quality check for the imaging data, convert DICOM into NRRD, 
perform basic image pre-processing, check ROI segmentation, and extract the radiomic features:  

* [tutorial imaging](imaging_module.md).

Example of mask alignment check:

## Features module
How to visualize features distribution in classes, 
plot the feature correlation matrix, 
check Mann-Whitney U-test p-values, plot univariate ROC 
(and calculate AUC) for each feature, perform volumetric analysis, 
and save all the scores:

* [tutorial features](features_module.md).

Exploratory feature analysis:  
![Exploratory feature analysis](features_example.png 'Exploratory feature analysis')  
A - feature value distributions in binary classes, B - Spearmanâ€™s correlation matrix between features, C - Mann-Whitney test (Bonferroni corrected) p-values, D - univariate ROC curves for binary classification, E - volume based precision-recall curve, F - features Spearman's correlation with volume.  
  
## Results module
How to get the formatted classification metrics with confidence intervals, 
plot confusion matrices and ROC curves: 

* [tutorial results](results_module.md).
