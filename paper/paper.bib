              diagnostics. However, the diagnostic accuracy of DL is uncertain.
              Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms
              to identify pathology in medical imaging. Searches were conducted
              in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 11,921
              studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review.
              Eighty-two studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115
              in respiratory disease were included for meta-analysis. Two
              hundred twenty-four studies in other specialities were included
              for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that reported on
              the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology
              using medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were
              measures of diagnostic accuracy, study design and reporting
              standards in the literature. Estimates were pooled using
              random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC's ranged
              between 0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy,
              age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma on retinal fundus
              photographs and optical coherence tomography. In respiratory
              imaging, AUC's ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung
              nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast
              imaging, AUC's ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing
              breast cancer on mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and digital breast
              tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between studies and
              extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome
              measures was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the
              diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms on medical imaging. There is
              an immediate need for the development of artificial
              intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in
              order to provide guidance around key issues in this field.",

  abstract = "Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is poorly
              sensitive to pathological changes related to multiple sclerosis
              (MS) in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and gray matter
              (GM), with the added difficulty of not being very reproducible.
              Quantitative MRI (qMRI), on the other hand, attempts to represent
              the physical properties of tissues, making it an ideal candidate
              for quantitative medical image analysis or radiomics. We
              therefore hypothesized that qMRI-based radiomic features have
              added diagnostic value in MS compared to cMRI. This study
              investigated the ability of cMRI (T1w) and qMRI features
              extracted from white matter (WM), NAWM, and GM to distinguish
              between MS patients (MSP) and healthy control subjects (HCS). We
              developed exploratory radiomic classification models on a dataset
              comprising 36 MSP and 36 HCS recruited in CHU Liege, Belgium,
              acquired with cMRI and qMRI. For each image type and region of
              interest, qMRI radiomic models for MS diagnosis were developed on
              a training subset and validated on a testing subset. Radiomic
              models based on cMRI were developed on the entire training
              dataset and externally validated on open-source datasets with 167
              HCS and 10 MSP. Ranked by region of interest, the best diagnostic
              performance was achieved in the whole WM. Here the model based on
              magnetization transfer imaging (a type of qMRI) features yielded
              a median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
              (AUC) of 1.00 in the testing sub-cohort. Ranked by image type,
              the best performance was achieved by the magnetization transfer
              models, with median AUCs of 0.79 (0.69-0.90, 90\% CI) in NAWM and
              0.81 (0.71-0.90) in GM. The external validation of the T1w models
              yielded an AUC of 0.78 (0.47-1.00) in the whole WM, demonstrating
              a large 95\% CI and a low sensitivity of 0.30 (0.10-0.70). This
              exploratory study indicates that qMRI radiomics could provide
              efficient diagnostic information using NAWM and GM analysis in
              MSP. T1w radiomics could be useful for a fast and automated check
              of conventional MRI for WM abnormalities once acquisition and
              reconstruction heterogeneities have been overcome. Further
              prospective validation is needed, involving more data for better
              interpretation and generalization of the results.",

  abstract = "Background Radiomic features may quantify characteristics present
              in medical imaging. However, the lack of standardized definitions
              and validated reference values have hampered clinical use.
              Purpose To standardize a set of 174 radiomic features. Materials
              and Methods Radiomic features were assessed in three phases. In
              phase I, 487 features were derived from the basic set of 174
              features. Twenty-five research teams with unique radiomics
              software implementations computed feature values directly from a
              digital phantom, without any additional image processing. In
              phase II, 15 teams computed values for 1347 derived features
              using a CT image of a patient with lung cancer and predefined
              image processing configurations. In both phases, consensus among
              the teams on the validity of tentative reference values was
              measured through the frequency of the modal value and classified
              as follows: less than three matches, weak; three to five matches,
              moderate; six to nine matches, strong; 10 or more matches, very
              strong. In the final phase (phase III), a public data set of
              multimodality images (CT, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and
              T1-weighted MRI) from 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma was
              used to prospectively assess reproducibility of standardized
              features. Results Consensus on reference values was initially
              weak for 232 of 302 features (76.8\%) at phase I and 703 of 1075
              features (65.4\%) at phase II. At the final iteration, weak
              consensus remained for only two of 487 features (0.4\%) at phase
              I and 19 of 1347 features (1.4\%) at phase II. Strong or better
              consensus was achieved for 463 of 487 features (95.1\%) at phase
              I and 1220 of 1347 features (90.6\%) at phase II. Overall, 169 of
              174 features were standardized in the first two phases. In the
              final validation phase (phase III), most of the 169 standardized
              features could be excellently reproduced (166 with CT; 164 with
              PET; and 164 with MRI). Conclusion A set of 169 radiomics
              features was standardized, which enabled verification and
              calibration of different radiomics software. \copyright{} RSNA,

              retrospective study was conducted in baseline 18
              F-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/ computed
              tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) images of 135 patients. The dataset
              was utilized for feature extraction of CT-radiomics features and
              PET metabolic parameters based on volume of interest, then went
              through feature selection and model development with strategy of
              five-fold cross-validation. Specifically, model development used
              support vector machine, PET metabolic parameters selection used
              Akaike's information criterion, and CT-radiomics were reduced by
              the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method then
              forward selection approach. The diagnostic performances of
              CT-radiomics, PET metabolic parameters and combination of both
              were illustrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
              curves, and compared by Delong test. Five groups of selected PET
              metabolic parameters and CT-radiomics were counted, and potential
              features were found and analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test.
              RESULTS: The CT-radiomics, PET metabolic parameters, and
              combination of both among five subsets showed mean area under the
              curve (AUC) of 0.820 $\pm$ 0.053, 0.874 $\pm$ 0.081, and 0.887

              among models were observed through pairwise comparison in each
              fold (P-value from 0.09 to 0.81, Delong test). The potential
              features were found to be SurfaceVolumeRatio and SUVpeak (P <

              using dynamic high-spatial-resolution MR imaging. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with suspicious mammographic or
              palpable findings underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced MR
              imaging of the breast using a three-time-point method of
              acquisition. Each lesion was prospectively analyzed by two
              independent radiologists for morphologic and visual dynamic
              enhancement characteristics. A classification and regression tree
              was used to examine the optimal order, cutoff points, and
              combination of imaging parameters to build a diagnostic rule
              separating benign from malignant lesions using histopathology
              findings as the standard of reference. Kappa statistics were used
              to determine observer variability. RESULTS: Among 23 benign and
              34 malignant lesions (12 invasive, three ductal carcinoma in
              situ, and 19 mixed cancer), margin morphology (p = 0.001) and
              enhancement pattern (p = 0.001) were the most significant MR
              imaging findings for lesion characterization. Focal mass lesions
              were classified as malignant when spiculated margins or both the
              washout enhancement pattern and ``nonsmooth'' margins were
              present. Interobserver agreement was almost perfect for washout
              pattern and substantial for margin assessment. In the limited

              sensitivity and positive predictive value of 97\% each and a
              specificity and negative predictive value of 96\% each.
              CONCLUSION: The washout enhancement pattern combined with lesion
              margin assessment on dynamic contrast-enhanced high-resolution MR
              imaging of the breast allows reproducible lesion characterization

              provide multi-parametric morphologic and functional information,
              are playing an increasingly significant role in precision
              medicine. Radiologists are trained to understand the imaging
              phenotypes, transcribe those observations (phenotypes) to
              correlate with underlying diseases and to characterize the
              images. However, in order to understand and characterize the
              molecular phenotype (to obtain genomic information) of solid
              heterogeneous tumours, the advanced sequencing of those tissues
              using biopsy is required. Thus, radiologists image the tissues
              from various views and angles in order to have the complete image
              phenotypes, thereby acquiring a huge amount of data. Deriving
              meaningful details from all these radiological data becomes
              challenging and raises the big data issues. Therefore, interest
              in the application of radiomics has been growing in recent years
              as it has the potential to provide significant interpretive and
              predictive information for decision support. Radiomics is a

              learning methods, and human skills, and thus can be used for
              quantitative characterization of tumour phenotypes. This paper

              Radiomic features have been shown to provide prognostic value in
              predicting clinical outcomes in several studies. However, several
              challenges including feature redundancy, unbalanced data, and
              small sample sizes have led to relatively low predictive
              accuracy. In this study, we explore different strategies for
              overcoming these challenges and improving predictive performance
              of radiomics-based prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer
              (NSCLC). CT images of 112 patients (mean age 75 years) with NSCLC
              who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy were used to predict
              recurrence, death, and recurrence-free survival using a

              modeling and feature selection methods, respectively, for
              achieving high prognosis performance. To address unbalanced data,
              Synthetic Minority Over-sampling technique was found to
              significantly increase predictive accuracy. A full analysis of

              However, before they can be used as biomarkers in clinical
              decision support systems, features need to be repeatable and
              reproducible. OBJECTIVE: Identify repeatable radiomics features
              within breast tissue on prospectively collected MRI exams through
              multiple test-retest measurements. STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
              POPULATION: 11 healthy female volunteers. FIELD
              STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5 T; MRI exams, comprising T2-weighted turbo
              spin-echo (T2W) sequence, native T1-weighted turbo gradient-echo
              (T1W) sequence, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence using
              b-values 0/150/800, and corresponding derived ADC maps.
              ASSESSMENT: 18 MRI exams (three test-retest settings, repeated on
              2 days) per healthy volunteer were examined on an identical
              scanner using a fixed clinical breast protocol. For each scan, 91
              features were extracted from the 3D manually segmented right
              breast using Pyradiomics, before and after image preprocessing.
              Image preprocessing consisted of 1) bias field correction (BFC);
              2) z-score normalization with and without BFC; 3) grayscale
              discretization using 32 and 64 bins with and without BFC; and 4)
              z-score normalization + grayscale discretization using 32 and 64
              bins with and without BFC. STATISTICAL TESTS: Features'
              repeatability was assessed using concordance correlation
              coefficient(CCC) for each pair, i.e. each MRI was compared to
              each of the remaining 17 MRI with a cut-off value of CCC > 0.90.
              RESULTS: Images without preprocessing produced the highest number
              of repeatable features for both T1W sequence and ADC maps with 15
              of 91 (16.5\%) and 8 of 91 (8.8\%) repeatable features,
              respectively. Preprocessed images produced between 4 of 91
              (4.4\%) and 14 of 91 (15.4\%), and 6 of 91 (6.6\%) and 7 of 91
              (7.7\%) repeatable features, respectively for T1W and ADC maps.
              Z-score normalization produced highest number of repeatable
              features, 26 of 91 (28.6\%) in T2W sequences, in these images, no
              preprocessing produced 11 of 91 (12.1\%) repeatable features.
              DATA CONCLUSION: Radiomic features extracted from T1W, T2W
              sequences and ADC maps from breast MRI exams showed a varying
              number of repeatable features, depending on the sequence. Effects
              of different preprocessing procedures on repeatability of
              features were different for each sequence. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2

               of AI is diagnostic imaging, and mounting attention is being
               directed at establishing and fine-tuning its performance to
               facilitate detection and quantification of a wide array of
               clinical conditions. Investigations leveraging computer-aided
               diagnostics have shown excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and
               specificity for the detection of small radiographic
               abnormalities, with the potential to improve public health.
               However, outcome assessment in AI imaging studies is commonly
               defined by lesion detection while ignoring the type and
               biological aggressiveness of a lesion, which might create a
               skewed representation of AI's performance. Moreover, the use of
               non-patient-focused radiographic and pathological endpoints

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Deep learning enables tremendous
              progress in medical image analysis. One driving force of this
              progress are open-source frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
              However, these frameworks rarely address issues specific to the
              domain of medical image analysis, such as 3-D data handling and
              distance metrics for evaluation. pymia, an open-source Python
              package, tries to address these issues by providing flexible data
              handling and evaluation independent of the deep learning
              framework. METHODS: The pymia package provides data handling and
              evaluation functionalities. The data handling allows flexible
              medical image handling in every commonly used format (e.g., 2-D,
              2.5-D, and 3-D; full- or patch-wise). Even data beyond images
              like demographics or clinical reports can easily be integrated
              into deep learning pipelines. The evaluation allows stand-alone
              result calculation and reporting, as well as performance
              monitoring during training using a vast amount of domain-specific
              metrics for segmentation, reconstruction, and regression.
              RESULTS: The pymia package is highly flexible, allows for fast
              prototyping, and reduces the burden of implementing data handling
              routines and evaluation methods. While data handling and
              evaluation are independent of the deep learning framework used,
              they can easily be integrated into TensorFlow and PyTorch
              pipelines. The developed package was successfully used in a
              variety of research projects for segmentation, reconstruction,
              and regression. CONCLUSIONS: The pymia package fills the gap of
              current deep learning frameworks regarding data handling and
              evaluation in medical image analysis. It is available at
              https://github.com/rundherum/pymia and can directly be installed

              personalized assistance in the clinical decision-making for
              different patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 142
              IDH-wild-type GBM patients classified using the new
              classification criteria of WHO 2021 from two centers were
              included in the study and randomly divided into a training set
              and a test set. Firstly, their clinical characteristics were
              screened using univariate Cox regression. Then, the radiomics
              features were extracted from the tumor and peritumoral edema
              areas on their contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (CE-T1WI),
              T2-weighted image (T2WI), and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated
              inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
              images. Subsequently, inter- and intra-class correlation
              coefficient (ICC) analysis, Spearman's correlation analysis,
              univariate Cox, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection
              operator (LASSO) Cox regression were used step by step for
              feature selection and the construction of a radiomics signature.
              The combined model was established by integrating the selected
              clinical factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for the
              validation of the discrimination ability of the model, and the
              C-index was used to evaluate consistency in the prediction.
              Finally, a Radiomics + Clinical nomogram was generated for
              personalized prognosis analysis and then validated using the
              calibration curve. Results: Analysis of the clinical
              characteristics resulted in the screening of four risk factors.
              The combination of ICC, Spearman's correlation, and univariate
              and LASSO Cox resulted in the selection of eight radiomics
              features, which made up the radiomics signature. Both the
              radiomics and combined models can significantly stratify high-
              and low-risk patients (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 for the training
              and test sets, respectively) and obtained good prediction
              consistency (C-index = 0.74-0.86). The calibration plots
              exhibited good agreement in both 1- and 2-year survival between
              the prediction of the model and the actual observation.
              Conclusion: Radiomics is an independent preoperative non-invasive
              prognostic tool for patients who were newly classified as having
              IDH-wild-type GBM. The constructed nomogram, which combined
              radiomics features with clinical factors, can predict the overall
              survival (OS) of IDH-wild-type GBM patients and could be a new
              supplement to treatment guidelines.",

Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting.

               a gift for titrating herbal medicine for wound healing and

               screening, diagnosing, phenotyping, therapeutic interventions,

               Instead, medicine has become a multi-disciplinary, complex and
